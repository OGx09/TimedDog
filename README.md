## TimedDog
An Android library for automatically logging out an app when a set time has elapsed. I have come across many solutions on both Github and Stackoverflow but none of them work as expected due to the new constraints on background processes in Android API 26. This library was built on   `WorkManager`, hence it will work on both apps targeting the latest Android SDKs down to Android API 16.

### Sample

##### Modify your application class or create one if it does not exist and initialize `TimedDog` in your onCreate() method.

```java
class MyApp extends Application{
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate(){
        ...
        TimedDog.init(this);
    }
}
```

##### Extend `TimeoutActivity` in your base activity or any other activity you wants to monitor. 
```java
class BaseActivity extends TimeoutActivity{
    //...
}
```
**Suggestion:** Extend `TimeOutActivity` on pages that can only be accessed after a user has successfully logged in to your app.

##### Finally, start `TimedDog` in your main activity onCreate's method.
```java
new TimedDogXWorker.Builder(this)
      .seconds(10)
      .listener(new TimedDogXWorker.OnTimeOutListener() {
      @Override
      public void onTimeOut(boolean isForeground) {
          //Start the LOGIN ACTIVITY here.
       }
     }).build();
```

#### How To Install

##### Add the jitpack repository to your build.gradle(project level) file
```groovy
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

##### Add the library to your build.gradle(app level) file and rebuild your project
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.devmike01:TimedDog:1.1.0'
```

**That's all**
